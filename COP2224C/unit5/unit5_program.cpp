    Unit 5 Program
    This program calculates and displays the amortization schedule for a loan.
    It simulates the repayment of a $1,000 loan with an annual interest rate
    of 7.2% and regular monthly payments of $25, tracking the principal and
    interest for each payment until the loan is fully repaid.
